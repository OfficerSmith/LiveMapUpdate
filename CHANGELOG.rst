v2.0.1 (22-09-2017)
-------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update how playercount is calculated (Fixes #5) [Jordan Dalton]

  The previous way of calculating the player count apparently didn't work. Now when the player leaves the server, they're removed from the local cache. This is then used to get the player count.

Fix
~~~
- Fixed minifying issues. [Jordan Dalton]

  Setting "$debug" to false  now correctly minifies the JS code. Before, it would minify it but syntax errors (missing semicolons) would cause the code to not execute.
  I've also added final_newline to the editor config (I can't remember where but, I heard it's better to have them).
- Fixed minifying issues. [Jordan Dalton]

  There was some issues when using the minifier ($debug = false). They were caused by missing semicolons (don't ask). So, now minifying should work like a charm.

Other
~~~~~
- Add .editorconfig. [AciD]

  - Added `.editorconfig` to standardize code formatting
  - Fixed formatting of neccesary files

- Update marker names. [Jordan Dalton]

  Made it so that markers have a default name, just in case we can't get any from the ajax request.

Fix
~~~
- Fixed blips not working. [Jordan Dalton]

  Withg the previous commit, I forgot to change a few thiings. Now everything should be working fine.

Other
~~~~~
- Add ajax request for blip data. [Jordan Dalton]

  Blips are not gotten from the server via ajax request to the URL that is set by the user.
- Minor changes. [Jordan Dalton]

  Removed whitespace infront of a player's name.
  Removed some JS that wasn't needed.
  Updated websocket to use the "getPlayerData" stuff
- Dynamically generated MarkerTypes. [Jordan Dalton]

  Holy fuck.. This took a lot of manual labour just to type out the blips the map can use :(

  Anyways, the MarkerTypes should now be generated when the page is loaded, saves on hardcoding each and every blip (there's hundereds) plus, it should allow for people to easily change the sprite sheet if they want.
- Added Google hack. [Jordan Dalton]

  This allows anyone to run the live map without having to get an API  key from Google (wohoo, freedom)
- Added runtime minifier. [Jordan Dalton]

  If "debug" is set to false in the index, the minifier script will minify the css and js code and insert it into the HTML page when it's requested (yey).

Fix
~~~
- Fixed hiding blips hiding players and added vehicle blips. [Jordan
  Dalton]

  Before, when hiding all blips the player blips would also be hidden. They should now be shown when other blips are hidden.

  When a player enters a vehicle, their blip changes to the appropriate icon and the vehicle name is displayed.

# fivem-webinterface

These are images for the LiveMap that include postal #'s and soon to come road names.[live_map](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/live_map).

<!-- TODO: Probably add some links or sommat to showcase it (e.g. http://illusivetea.me/livemap/)-->

## Prerequisites

In order to have this working, it is advised that you already have a webserver running and correctly configured.
You will also need to install [live_map](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/live_map) on your FiveM server and have it configured.


## Configuration

Pretty much everything can be configured inside the `utils/config.php` file.
The variables have a brief description so you can get an idea of what values need to be where.

## Thanks

This project took a few people to put it toghether and this update is only map textures.

# fivem-webinterface

This is the Web Interface for the FiveM addon [live_map](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/live_map).

<!-- TODO: Probably add some links or sommat to showcase it (e.g. http://illusivetea.me/livemap/)-->

## Prerequisites

In order to have this working, it is advised that you already have a webserver running and correctly configured.
You will also need to install [live_map](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/live_map) on your FiveM server and have it configured.

## How to install

- Download the [latest version](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/live_map-interface/archive/master.zip) and the [images (225 MB)](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/live_map-interface/releases/download/v0.1/map.images.zip).

- Extract the web interface to your website.

- Create a new directory for the map images (e.g. `images/map/`)

- Extract the images to the map directory (e.g. `images/map/`)

- Configure the interface by changing the values in `utils/config.php`

## Configuration

Pretty much everything can be configured inside the `utils/config.php` file.
The variables have a brief description so you can get an idea of what values need to be where.

## Thanks

Special thanks to the people who helped me test this, flushing out any bugs that managed to sneak in.
